    <p>David Lunceford - WDD130</p>
    <p>My major is Cloud Computing. I'm the oldest of 13 kids, 
        my family has lived in Illinois, California, Utah, Maryland, and
        Arizona. I individually have also moved to North Carolina, Idaho, 
        and I spent a short month in Germany with my buddy Luca and his family.
    </p>
    <p>I love psychology, sociology, tech, religion, and metaphysics. I love to share things 
        that have helped me so that I can help other people find truth. I look
        for truth wherever it is best represented.
    </p>
    <p>I build computers, I interned senior year of high school at a 
        store in Auburn, California called Computer Addiction, where
        I learned how to assemble desktop PC's and replace screens and other 
        components in laptop units. I love PC hardware and am currently running
        my second homemade desktop along with an MSI Stealth laptop which 
        is also my baby.
