                <p id="homepagetext">The DAVROCKET 42 launch is coming soon! By the time you read this it may have already happened. The launch date is set for April 1st, 2024. The vision of the great David Lunceford has guided this project for the last 20 years. He started designing the world’s first 1000 foot tall starship capable of carrying a payload of up to 700 tons when he was only 4 years of age, pulling inspiration from shows like Jimmy Neutron and 2001: A Space Odyssey. When asked about his budding engineering enterprise, four-year-old David replied, “I like space ship.”  The Onion News Network asked him what his intentions for the space program were. “I want to fly really, really high and go around the Earth, and then I want to go to the Moon and I want to go to Mars and then, and then- I take the spaceship to fight the aliens and I don’t know what else,” David said, finishing up his statement. 20 years later the rocket is complete and awaiting its glorious launch into space. “I worked so hard on this project, I hope I get an A,” the now 24 year old David Lunceford said to the Global News Network. The world has never seen anything like this! This rocket will be able to reach heights and places we have only ever dreamed of. And taken satellite and mobile drone images of as well, but David's dreams are still coming true regardless!</p>
