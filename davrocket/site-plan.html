      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My idea is to have a website detailing a fictitious space shuttle launch that I will be hosting on April 1st, 2024. The purpose is to be a funny goof that also shows my ability to code html and css.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audiences is males in their twenties who would think it’s funny. I think it’s a great idea, and there will be no shortage of fictitious facts to help engage with the audience.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        The DAVROCKET 42 launch is coming soon! By the time you read this it may have already happened. The launch date is set for April 1st, 2024. The vision of the great David Lunceford has guided this project for the last 20 years. He started designing the world’s first 1000 foot tall starship capable of carrying a payload of up to 700 tons! He started designing it when he was only 4 years of age, pulling inspiration from shows like Jimmy Neutron and 2001: A Space Odyssey. When asked about his budding engineering enterprise, four-year-old David replied, “I like space ship.“ The Onion News Network asked him what his intentions for the space program were. “I want to fly really, really high and go around the Earth, and then I want to go to the Moon and I want to go to Mars and then I don’t know what else,” David said, finishing up his statement. 20 years later the rocket is complete and awaiting its glorious launch into space. “I worked so hard on this project, I hope I get an A,” the now 24 year old David Lunceford said to the Global News Network. The world has never seen anything like this! This rocket will be able to reach heights and places we have only ever dreamed of.

      <h3>Current Flight Plan and Itinerary</h3>
      <p>
        David Lunceford’s DAVROCKET 42 will undergo a deep space journey following its launch into space on April 1st, 2024. Some changes will take place to the original plan for the rockets course through space. The first stop will be the Moon. We’re going to take some lunar landers and take them off-roading for a while on the Moon’s surface. That would be epic and a great YouTube video. After the initial gallivanting with our lunar landers our team of scientists and engineers will build several large sand forts out of the Moon sand and have a moonball fight. Moonballs are tightly packed balls of Moon sand that are similar to snowballs, but heavier and a way bigger pain in the butt when one gets hit by one. It will be a somewhat risky endeavor but the teams I have put together should be able to complete the mission. Whoever’s fort gets damaged by Moonballs the most loses and will have to pack up all the equipment so we can launch off to our next destination. Before we leave we will post the DAVROCKET Nation’s flag on the winning fort for aliens and other astronauts to see. After we finish at the Moon, our team will take DAVROCKET 42 to Mars, where we will explore the terrain for a few days to get the feel of the land. We are going to build a roller coaster with the equipment we brought from Earth to prove to my friend Jimmy that it is possible to have a roller coaster on another planet. (This is possible because of the immense payload capacity of the DAVROCKET 42). After the roller coaster is built my team will ride it for as long as they can and see who can last the longest without getting sick and filling up their helmet with what we’re going to specify as regret. After the Mars trip we will fly by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, but since each of them would be impossible or at least near-impossible to land on, we will just take pictures for Instagram and further posterity.

      <h3>Technical Specs of DAVROCKET 42</h3>
      <p>
        The DAVROCKET 42 payload can reach up to 1000 tons of material, comfortably carrying whatever is needed for any space endeavor. It is powered by 20 RS-25 engines, the most powerful engines technologically available. It carries 140,000,000 gallons of super-cooled liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. It is 1000 feet tall and capable of reaching planets at the edge of our solar system. From its fuel-propulsion system, the DAVROCKET 42 has 10,240,000 pounds of thrust, the highest Earth has ever seen.
