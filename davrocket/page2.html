            <p>  David Lunceford’s DAVROCKET 42 will undergo a deep space journey following its launch into space on April 1st, 2024. Some changes will take place to the original plan for the rockets course through space. The first stop will be the Moon. We’re going to take some lunar landers and take them off-roading for a while on the Moon’s surface. That would be epic and a great YouTube video. After the initial gallivanting with our lunar landers our team of scientists and engineers will build several large sand forts out of the Moon sand and have a moonball fight. Moonballs are tightly packed balls of Moon sand that are similar to snowballs, but heavier and a way bigger pain in the butt when one gets hit by one. It will be a somewhat risky endeavor but the teams I have put together should be able to complete the mission. Whoever’s fort gets damaged by Moonballs the most loses and will have to pack up all the equipment so we can launch off to our next destination. Before we leave we will post the DAVROCKET Nation’s flag on the winning fort for aliens and other astronauts to see. After we finish at the Moon, our team will take DAVROCKET 42 to Mars, where we will explore the terrain for a few days to get the feel of the land. We are going to build a roller coaster with the equipment we brought from Earth to prove to my friend Jimmy that it is possible to have a roller coaster on another planet. (This is possible because of the immense payload capacity of the DAVROCKET 42). After the roller coaster is built my team will ride it for as long as they can and see who can last the longest without getting sick and filling up their helmet with what we’re going to specify as regret. After the Mars trip we will fly by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, but since each of them would be impossible or at least near-impossible to land on, we will just take pictures for Instagram and further posterity. </p>
